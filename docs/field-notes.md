# Field Notes

I would read this project from the data inward: cases first, implementation second.

The domain cases cover `file span`, `terminal width`, `argument risk`, and `report density`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

The widest spread is between `file span` and `terminal width`, so those are the first two cases I would preserve during a refactor.

The extra check gives the repository a behavior path that can fail for a domain reason, not only a syntax reason.
